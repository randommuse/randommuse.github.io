## How this works?

### Add/Edit notes

You can create a *category* inside the "_notes" folder by simply creating another folder with the desiring name. Remeber to create a corresponding .md file. See how it works for other categories.

To add a notes, simply create another .md file with some header (you can simply copy-paste from other existing notes). Then you can start editting! You can use latex, markdown, and html.

### Add/Edit blog posts

Basically the same as notes, the only difference is that the files are in the "_posts" folder.

### Test in localhost

Simply type "jekyll serve" on your terminal and go to "http://localhost:4000" with any browser.

### Push to github

Simply type "rake publish" on your terminal.
